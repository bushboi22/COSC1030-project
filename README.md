 Temperature monitor
By Jeremy, Eli, Mikhail, Hang, and Armaan

This program is meant for a user to hook up a D11 temperature/humidity monitor and a raspberry pi and the code executed prints out the temperature
on an LED screen that currently is hooked up to a solderless breadboard that hosts our D11 Temp sensor and LED screen. 

No one likes cold feet in the winter so know what temperature it is outside!!!
